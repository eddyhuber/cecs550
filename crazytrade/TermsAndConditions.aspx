        By using our services, you agree that at any time, if we feel as if the police or interpol is moving in on our
        operations, that we may go ahead and withdraw any assets you have with us, take off with your money, and run
        to a far away, non-extraditing country; preferrably somewhere tropical, never to return or be heard from or seen again.
